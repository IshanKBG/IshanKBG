Hello I am Ishan Jaiswal and I love creating softwares. 
Check my website [here](https://ishankbg.dev/about) for more information.

## Background
I have been creating softwares since 2019. I have tremendous experience in Typescript, C, Rust and Go. I also worked with several technologies like Docker, Postgres, GCP and AWS. My favourite framework is [Remix](https://remix.run) and I have been using it even before it got open sourced.
I also have a blog [here](https://ishankbg.dev) where I write about my experiences and learnings.
